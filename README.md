# Custom-Shell
This is a simple command-line shell program written in C. It implements basic shell functionality like handling built-in commands (e.g., exit, cd, help, hello) and running external commands (e.g., ls, pwd, echo) using fork() and execvp(). The shell provides a minimalistic interface for interacting with the system through the command line.
